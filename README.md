# Realistic Diffraction

Practical Acquisition and Rendering of Diffraction Effects in Surface Reflectance. Antoine Toisoul and Abhijeet Ghosh. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2017 (presentation at SIGGRAPH 2017).

#### Description

Realistic diffraction is an implementation of the paper Practical Acquisition and Rendering of Diffraction Effects in Surface Reflectance. Antoine Toisoul and Abhijeet Ghosh. ACM Transactions on Graphics, 2017. It allows the computation of diffraction lookup tables that can be used for real-time rendering of diffraction effects given the HDR photograph of a diffraction pattern measured with a spectral filter. The software requires OpenCV to work with images. It has been tested with OpenCV 2.4.11.

#### Usage

An example of how to compute a diffraction lookup table is given in main.cpp. The function that computes the lookup table is given in huygens.cpp.
